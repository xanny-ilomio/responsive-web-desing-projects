                <p>Check the pet food aisle at your local supermarket, and you'll find dozens of varieties of food to entice your cat. Feed your cat too little or the wrong kind of food, and he won't maintain good health. Feed him too much, and he'll get fat. But you can help get your cat off on the right paw by establishing regular feeding routines.</p>

                    <h3>Dry Food</h3>
                    <p> Dry food may be less expensive than canned cat food and may stay fresher longer. Cats that eat only dry food need to be provided with lots of fresh water, especially if they are prone to developing urinary tract blockages. For all cats, constant availability of fresh, clean water is important.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Wet Food</h3>
                    <p>Canned or wet cat food may be a little more inconvenient than a big bag of kibble, but has several advantages over dry food. Wet food are typically lower in carbohydrates, and so are less likely to lead to obesity. Canned wet food is also much higher in moisture content. This extra hydration can be especially helpful, because many cats don't drink enough water each day.</p>

                    <h3>Homemade</h3>
                    <p>The idea of preparing a special homemade meal for your cat can sound like a labour of love, but unfortunately it isn’t recommended. It’s difficult to provide the best cat diet using home-cooked or raw foods as some ingredients have very high or low quantities of essential nutrients.
                        <br>
                        Raw meat can also contain parasites and bacteria, such as Salmonella, which can make your cat ill so, as a cat owner, you need to pay particular attention to hygiene if you decide to feed a raw diet. Be very careful too about bones as these can splinter and even lodge in your cat’s intestine.

                <header>Litter box</header>
                <p>All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet, accessible location. In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. Avoid moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the box just a few inches per day. Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy, smelly litter box, so scoop solid wastes out of the box at least once a day. Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week; you can do this less frequently if using clumping litter. Don't use ammonia, deodorants or scents, especially lemon, when cleaning the litter box.</p>
                <p>If your cat will not use a litterbox, please consult with your veterinarian. Sometimes refusal to use a litter box is based on a medical condition that required treatment. </p>

                    <strong>Cat trees and Scratching posts</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p>Cat trees are a great plus for new cats adjusting to your home. They can act as a safe space, which is especially important when your kitty is getting used to their new house. Feline friends are also bound to explore and hide in a cat tree and feel secure in a high place overlooking their families.
                        <br>
                        Scratching posts are another furniture item to have for your cat. Not only do they help with maintaining nail length, but scratching posts also help your kitty adjust to their new space quickly. Need something more affordable? Cardboard scratchboards are generally less expensive and cats love them all the same!

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Kitties get their very own commode at home. Pick up a litter box – one per cat – with a scoop and unscented litter.

                    <strong>Enrichment</strong>
                    <p>
                        Cats need enriching activities to exercise their brains around the house. Get a variety of toys that keep your cat entertained like an assortment of balls, feather toys, pole toys, mice and more.
                        <br>
                        Every cat has different tastes – your cat may love ping pong balls and another may prefer to chase after a stuffed toy. Once your cat is over six months old, feel free to play around with catnip by stuffing it into soft toys. Don’t worry — it’s not addictive for cats!
                        <br>
                        Keep things interesting for your kitty by having about four or five toys available and rotating them each week. Household items like cardboard toilet paper rolls, plastic shower rings and paper bags with the handles removed are also great, affordable toy alternatives.

                    <strong>Grooming</strong>
                    <p>
                        You’ll have the prettiest cat in town when you have the right grooming goods. Having a brush on hand helps with shedding, matted fur and preventing hairballs. To keep kitty’s claws pristine, grab a pair of nail clippers that are scissor-shaped – they’re more comfortable for feline friends.
