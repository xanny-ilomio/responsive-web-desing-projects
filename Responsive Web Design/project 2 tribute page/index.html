                <h2>backstory</h2>
                <p>Heather Spencer, a volunteer of Simply Cats (in Boise, Idaho) was contacted about a litter of kittens that needed a foster home. "My friend who does TNR (trap-neuter-return), rescued 19 kittens and brought them to the shelter," Heather told Love Meow.</p>

                <p>She had space at home so immediately offered to help. One of the kittens stood out as being exceptionally small compared to her litter mates.</p>
                    
                <p>The kitten was named Winky, and despite being around two months old, she was just palm-sized.
                <p>Winky was born with dwarfism, a rare genetic mutation, which gives her noticeably short legs and a larger head.</p>
                <p>She came to the rescue with some respiratory issues, leaky eyes and was put on a special diet for chronic constipation.</p>
                <p>Winky is very laid-back and enjoys hanging out with Heather and her husband, snoozing away in the crook of their necks â€” her favorite pastime.</p>
